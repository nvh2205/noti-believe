# Endpoint Naming Rules in NestJS

## General Rules
- All endpoints must be named according to kebab-case (a-b) convention.
- All endpoints must have swagger documentation.
- Do not use camelCase (aB) or special characters.
- Do not use HTTP verb prefixes such as get, post, put, delete, update in endpoint names.


## Examples
- Correct: `user-profile`, `data`, `user-info`
- Incorrect: `userProfile`, `getData`, `updateUserInfo`, `get-data`, `update-user-info`

## Application
- Applied to all controllers in the project
- Applied to both path and param in endpoints
- Applied to both sub-endpoints and main endpoints

## Reasons
- Easy to read and understand
- Good compatibility with other systems
- Standardization of APIs throughout the system
- Avoids duplication with HTTP methods already specified in decorators (@Get, @Post, @Put, @Delete)
